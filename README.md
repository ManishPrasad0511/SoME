# SoME

The Summer of Math Exposition (SoME) is an online competition to encourage people to post explanatory videos/blog posts online about math. I am currently working on a problem about all possible ways of reflection of light confined in a 7-dimensional room. \
I recently competed in the Online Physics Olympiad with two of my friends. And there was one question, particularly, with a really elegant and beautiful solution. Here is the question: Consider two points, S and S ′, randomly placed inside a D-dimensional hyper-rectangular room with walls that are perfect-reflecting (D − 1)-dimensional hyperplane mirrors. How many different light rays that start from S and go to S’  reflect N times on one of the walls and N − 1 times on each of the rest? Use D = 7 and N = 3.

There are four files. I have added the timings of where all the animations are in the video at the top of all of these files. And you can run the code in google colab by clicking "Open In Colab".
